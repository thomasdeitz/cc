A hard rock combo in the grand, riffy tradition of stadium titans like Aerosmith and Led Zeppelin, Dirty Honey rose out of Los Angeles' club scene in 2019 with their self-titled debut EP.

Singer Marc Labelle, guitarist John Notto, bassist Justin Smolian, and drummer Corey Coverstone cut their teeth developing a classic hard rock sound deeply indebted to the aforementioned rock giants as well as second wave purveyors like the Black Crowes. Their 2018 debut single "Fire Away" earned some national exposure and was followed in 2019 by their eponymous EP, which was produced by rock veteran Nick Didia (Pearl Jam, Rage Against the Machine). Tours supporting like-minded acts Red Sun Rising and Goodbye June, as well a string of festival appearances, followed. ~ Timothy Monger

Originally from rural Charleston, WV, the guys in American Minor relocated to the college town of Champaign, IL, around 2002. The young quintet made a quick impression locally with its blend of stinging hard rock, old Faces records, and shades of blues and Southern rock, and soon a buzz was afoot. Eventually Rob McCutcheon (vocals), Bud Carroll (guitar), Bruno (bass), Josh Knox (drums), and Josh Gragg (guitar) hooked up with David Lowery, who helped them record a demo. South by Southwest followed in 2004, and American Minor caught the ear of ex-Blind Melon members Christopher Thorn and Brad Smith, who brought the band to Jive Records. American Minor signed, and issued the Buffalo Creek EP through Jive in October 2004. Their self-titled full-length followed in August 2005. ~ Johnny Loftus

Texas guitarist, singer, and blues-rocker Tyler Bryant started playing guitar at the age of six; by 11 he was good enough to jam with adult players and it was clear what his future avocation would be. He moved to Nashville during his senior year of high school (he finished his classes and coursework online and graduated after the move), and he has really never looked back, developing into an explosive and talented blues and hard rock guitarist, even playing Eric Clapton's Crossroads Festival at the age of 15. Along the way, Bryant assembled a powerhouse band, the Shakedown, comprised of Caleb Crosby on drums, Noah Denney on bass, and Graham Whitford, the son of Aerosmith's Brad Whitford, on second guitar. Quickly earning a buzz on the blues and rock touring circuit, the band opened shows for the likes of Aerosmith, B.B. King, and Clapton, among others, and released an EP, My Radio, in the spring of 2011, following it with a seven-track album, From the Sandcastle, in the fall. A 12-track full-length, Wild Child, recorded in analog with engineer Vance Powell, appeared early in 2013. The success of Wild Child helped to land the group a deal with John Varvatos/Republic Records, who would put out their 2015 EP, The Wayside. The following year, they supported Guns N' Roses on tour. In 2017, they returned with the eponymous full-length Tyler Bryant & the Shakedown, featuring the single "Heartland." Truth & Lies followed in 2019. ~ Steve Leggett

Some musicians take a while to build an audience and connect with fans. For the Los Angeles-based quartet Dirty Honey, success came right out of the gate...   Released in March 2019, the band’s debut single, “When I’m Gone,” became the first song by an unsigned artist to reach No. 1 on Billboard’s Mainstream Rock chart. Their second single, “Rolling 7s,” went into the Top 5. Dirty Honey opened for The Who, Guns ’N Roses, Slash and Alter Bridge, and was the “must-see” at major rock festivals such as Rocklahoma, Louder Than Life, Heavy MTL, and Epicenter. On their first U.S. headline tour, the band sold out every date.   The band (Marc LaBelle/vocals, John Notto/guitar, Justin Smolian/bass, and Corey Coverstone/drums) worked again with producer Nick DiDia (Rage Against the Machine, Pearl Jam) on their self-titled album that captures the lightning-in-a-bottle dynamics and energy of their live sound. The new Dirty Honey upcoming album indeed builds on the band’s output to date, driven by the smoking lead single “California Dreamin'” that muses about life’s ebbs and flows, even in paradise. With airtight songwriting that plays up their strengths: sexy, bluesy, nasty rock’n’roll, melodic hard rock, and soulful ‘70s blues-rock.   Dirty Honey is about to take 2021 by storm.

When they first began writing for their new album, Feral Roots, Rival Sons vocalist Jay Buchanan and guitarist Scott Holiday holed up for a week in a bare-bones shack just off the historic Natchez Trace. There, in the lavishly overgrown wilderness of the South Tennessee woods, they bore the genesis of Rival Sons’ new full-length Album. For the Long Beach, California band's debut for Low Country Sound/Atlantic Records—Feral Roots echoes its origins with a sound and spirit both thrillingly untamed and wildly majestic. Produced by Rival Sons’ longtime collaborator, Dave Cobb (the Grammy Award-winner known for his work with such artists as Jason Isbell, Chris Stapleton, John Prine and Brandi Carlile), Feral Roots came to life at Nashville’s famed RCA Studio A and at the iconic Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Alabama. In a departure from the off-the-cuff creativity that sparked their previous albums, however, Rival Sons immersed themselves in a far more gradual and measured writing process for Feral Roots. “In the past we’ve made records where we come off the road and go right into the studio after the last gig, but for this one we allowed ourselves more time to focus,” says Holiday. Despite its sprawling arrangements and shapeshifting textures, the album still bears a brutal vitality deeply rooted in Rival Sons’ on-spot recording approach.

This hard rock duo has taken inspiration from bands as diverse as Blackberry Smoke and Black Sabbath. Eleven year old identical twins Isaac and Lucas are . Pulling inspiration from bands like Blackberry Smoke, Black Sabbath, Rival Sons, Marcus King, Dirty Honey and Lynyrd Skynyrd – Candy Cigarette’s sound might be best described as heavy southern blues featuring dark syrupy rock tones, whimsical melodies and a sprinkle of southern soul. These two are looking to continue down the path of those bands working to stage a rock n' roll comeback.

Being musical from a young age, the Deitz brothers began learning piano at the age of 6 all the while waiting for the chance to pick up something a little louder. In the spring of 2019 they got their chance. Lucas picked up guitar while Isaac focused on bass. It didn’t take long for them to translate what they were learning into original songs, so in the fall of 2019 Candy Cigarette was born as a way to focus their creativity and give it direction.

As they continued to hone their craft, they also continued to write and are currently recording their first EP which should be done baking in late spring of 2021. The good news is that you should be able to get a little taste ahead of time with their single “Sister Bay” available now!
