    <p>
        Formed in 2019 by then 10 year old identical twins Isaac and Lucas Deitz, Wisconsin based blues rock 3 piece Candy Cigarette takes sonic cues from groups ranging from Black Sabbath and Rival Sons to The Allman Brothers and Blackberry Smoke. After self releasing their quarantine fueled debut EP in 2021 the Deitz twins began playing live shows across the state, racking up over 100 performances in 2022. The boys are grateful to have  had the opportunity to play venues and festivals like The Back Bar, Blues from the Top, Summerfest, and Big Turn Music Festival supporting artists like The Other LA, Larkin Poe, Sue Foley, and Big Head Todd. In late 2022 drummer Evan Sterken stepped into the group and now with a more dynamic show than ever this group is poised to chase down their rock and roll dreams.
